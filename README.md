## ✨ Overview

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning** can automate the process of **loan approval prediction** — helping banks assess loan eligibility faster and more accurately.  
The model predicts whether a loan will be **Approved (Y)** or **Not Approved (N)** based on applicant features such as income, employment type, loan amount, and credit history.  

🎯 **Goal:** Build and compare ML models to predict loan approval status.  
💡 **Key Learning:** Data preprocessing, feature encoding, model comparison, and evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset Details

📄 **File:** `LoanApprovalPrediction.csv`  
The dataset contains 13 columns describing the applicant and loan attributes:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Gender | Applicant gender |
| Married | Marital status |
| Dependents | Number of dependents |
| Education | Graduate / Non-Graduate |
| Self_Employed | Employment type |
| ApplicantIncome | Income of the applicant |
| CoapplicantIncome | Income of co-applicant |
| LoanAmount | Loan amount in thousands |
| Loan_Amount_Term | Term of loan in months |
| Credit_History | History of credit repayment |
| Property_Area | Urban / Semi-urban / Rural |
| Loan_Status | Target (Y/N) |
| Loan_ID | Identifier (dropped) |

## 📘 Notebook Workflow

📓 File: `Loan_Approval_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`

The notebook performs the complete ML pipeline:

1. 🧹 **Data Cleaning** — Handle missing values, remove irrelevant columns.  
2. 🔠 **Encoding** — Convert categorical data into numerical form using Label Encoding.  
3. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Visualize distributions & correlations.  
4. ⚙️ **Model Training** — Fit and test multiple ML models.  
5. 📈 **Evaluation** — Compare model accuracy and performance.

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing & EDA

- Dropped `Loan_ID` since it's not predictive.  
- Handled missing values using **mean imputation**.  
- Encoded categorical variables with **LabelEncoder**.  
- Visualized key relationships:
  - 🔸 Credit history vs Loan Status (strong correlation ✅)
  - 🔸 Income distribution among approved vs rejected loans
  - 🔸 Property area’s impact on approval rates

📊 **Insight:** Applicants with a good credit history and higher income have a higher chance of loan approval.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models

The following ML models were implemented and evaluated:

| Algorithm | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| 🧩 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | Simple distance-based classifier |
| 🌲 Random Forest Classifier | Ensemble of decision trees (best performer) |
| 🔹 Support Vector Classifier (SVC) | Classifies using optimal hyperplane |
| 🧮 Logistic Regression | Statistical model for binary classification |

---

## 🧪 Results Summary

| Model | Test Accuracy | Remarks |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| 🌲 Random Forest | **82.5%** ✅ | Best performer |
| 🧮 Logistic Regression | 80.8% | Consistent and interpretable |
| 🔹 SVC | 69.1% | Needs parameter tuning |
| 🧩 KNN | 63.7% | Sensitive to scaling |

📈 **Conclusion:** Random Forest gave the best balance of accuracy and interpretability for this dataset.
